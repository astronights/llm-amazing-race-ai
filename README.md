The game challenges players to solve riddles and navigate through various cities and points of interest, using an AI-powered system to deliver a unique and engaging experience.

## üéØ Project Overview

The game is built with a modern tech stack combining TypeScript, Next.js, and Python, leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs) to create dynamic and immersive gameplay. Players will embark on a virtual adventure where they must solve riddles to discover and travel to various landmarks around the world.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### **Frontend:**

### **Backend:**
- **Python**: The backend is powered by Python, which handles the game's logic, interacts with the LLM, and processes data from the location services.
- **LangChain**: This framework orchestrates the interaction with the LLM, making it easier to integrate complex language models into the game.
- **Gemini LLM**: The Gemini LLM is used to generate riddles, provide hints, and interact with players in a natural language format.

### **Data:**
- **Open Source Location Data**: The game utilizes open source location datasets to query cities and points of interest. This data is essential for creating accurate and meaningful challenges based on real-world locations.

## üåü Features

- **Interactive Riddles**: Players must solve AI-generated riddles to identify their next destination.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Each playthrough is unique, with the LLM generating different riddles and routes based on the player's progress.
